CBOR is simple enough to implement from scratch for a specific application.
For applications where that is not desirable, generic implementations are available for a variety of platforms. 
Many of these implementations stay private, but some are published with liberal open-source licenses such as the Apache 2.0 or the MIT license.

This project implement CBOR encoding and decoding in LabVIEW.

Find the sample program in Test folder to excersie the functionality.
